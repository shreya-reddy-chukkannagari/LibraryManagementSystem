LibraryMaganementSystem

A library management is an application that manages and stores books 
information electronically according to userâ€™s needs. The system helps both 
users and library manager to keep a constant track of all the books available in 
the library. It allows both the admin and the student to search for the desired 
book. It becomes necessary for all libraries to keep a continuous check on the 
books issued and returned. This task if carried out manually will be tedious and 
includes chances of mistakes. These errors are avoided by allowing the system 
to keep track of information such as issue date, last date to return the book and 
thus there is no need to keep manual track of this information which thereby 
avoids chances of mistakes.
The following are the functionalities available in our application.
1. Each user has one unique library card if they are in the system.
2. The library needs to know the name, address, phone number and library 
card number for each user.
3. At any point in time, the library may need to know or to calculate the 
books a user has checked out, when they are due, and any outstanding 
overdue fines.
4. Children (<=12) can only check out five books at a time.
5. A user can check out books or audio/video materials.
6. Books are checked out for three weeks, unless they are current best 
sellers, the limit is for two weeks. 
7. Audio/video materials may be checked out for two weeks. 
8. The overdue fine is ten cents per book per day but the price of the book 
cannot be higher than the value of the overdue.
9. The library also has reference books and magazines, which cannot be 
checked out.
10. A user can request a book or audio/video item that is not currently 
available.
11. A user can renew a book once (and only once), unless there is an 
outstanding request
